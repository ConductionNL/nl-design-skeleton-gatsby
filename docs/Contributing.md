# Contributing

Thanks for checking out the Commonground project documentation! You are more than welcome to contribute if you see any inconsistencies, errors, or spelling mistakes that slipped through.

We host technical documentation on Read the Doc's and general user information on GitHub pages. We document in markdown (instead of reStructuredText) to make the documentation compatible with GitHub. Documentation is part of the project and contained within the `/docs` folder.

This is an open-source project, so every contribution forfeits any intellectual property claim. Of course, you are free to share and use our documentation in any way you see fit.

We've put together the following guidelines to help you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and that you should expect from others):

-   Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
-   If you open a pull request, please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before merging your contribution.
-   When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created, as others will do if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the issues and pull requests to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, open a pull request.

## Use a coherent style

To adhere a coding and writing style we use the already existing [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/). We are using StyleCi for automated test on our coding style. For additions to the documentation, we kindly request using [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)

## Setting up your environment
