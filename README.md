# NL Design Skeleton Application

The NL Design Skeleton application is designed for rapid application testing and prototype development on the NL Design System. It provides a basic skeleton application with full NL Design system functionality that any developer can easily extend, view locally and deploy to an online environment for demonstration purposes. The main benefits are:

-   Development and (online) demonstration of prototypes without the need of a server.
-   An out-of-the-box basic application that doesn't require configuration or setup and can be extended immediately.

The application is available in two versions, a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) version, and a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) version. We recommend the Gatsby version with deployment through Gatsby pages if you want to deploy your prototype without setting up a server.

## Getting started

To set up your own project, you will need a GitHub account and be logged in. Simply click on the "use this template" button. Tell GitHub where you want to spin up your prototype and click "create a repository from template".

## Spinning up your local environment

You will need a Git client, Node.js, and Yarn installed on your local machine for this part of the tutorial.

To develop locally, clone your new repository to your local machine. Open the terminal, navigate to the folder containing your repository, and start up Gatsby or Next.js in development mode with the following commands.

**Nextjs**

"`cli
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev

```

**Gatsby**

"`cli
$ npm install
$ npm run develop
```

After succesfully setting up your dev environment, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) on Next.js or to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) for Gatsby and see the same application as on
[https://conductionnl.github.io/nl-design-skeleton-gatsby/](https://conductionnl.github.io/nl-design-skeleton-gatsby/). Feel free to open up your project code and make some changes. You should see the changes in your development environment instantaneously due to hot-reloading.

## Publishing your prototype to the internet (Gatsby only)

The Gatsby version of the skeleton application has build-in support for GitHub pages, meaning you can build your application into a static website and publish it as a Github page. The skeleton repository comes with a build-in GitHub action for publishing itself as a GitHub page. You can have your prototype automatically published to the internet on a code push this way.

You need to activate GitHub pages on your repository for this to work. Go to your repository's settings, go to pages, select `gh-pages` as a source, and save (if you do not see a gh-pages branch, you can create one by pushing to main).

After saving, wait for GitHub to publish your project and provide you with a link you can share for your demo. Keep in mind that all pushes to main will result in updates to your online demo environment from this point on.

## Technical Documentation

Full technical documentation is provided on [read the docs](https://skeleton-app.readthedocs.io/en/latest//) and is based on [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). A more product owner focused (and less technical) product page is hosted at [link to be added]().

If you want to run the technical documentation locally, you can do so by using MKDocs build server and the serve command. Just go to the local repository and execute the following command for the documenation to be available on [port 8000](localhost://8000). Make sure to [install MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) first.
